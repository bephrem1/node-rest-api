**Comments:**</br>
Node is very granular in handling API requests. It is very interesting, the more I dig into node the more I see that it lets you be very explicit and control the request response cycle all in your hands. Spring Boot on the other hand has a high level of abstraction that some may like but I am enjoying node...I like seeing everything that is happening in the API creation and the accessing of routes. On the other hand for rapid development Spring with its auto-configurations would certainly seem easier short-term.

**Note:** node_modules folder has not been uploaded, simply run 'npm install' to load the required modules into your project</br>
